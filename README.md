# AV Code-Test

## Code Test

Please see coding exercise here:

**Front End in React:**

- Create a form to upload a csv to the backend service.
- CSV could be anywhere between **5MB** to **500GB**.
- Format of CSV(create your own for testing):

**`First_Name, Last_Name, ID`**

`Mark, Twain, 1`

`Stephen, King, 2`

`Charles, Dickens, 3`

- Show validation errors coming from the backend.

**Backend Service in Node.js:**

- Write a backend service that receives a POST call with the CSV payload.
- Validate the file for correctness(existence of `First_Name`, `Last_Name`, `ID` in the header, **a non-empty string** for first name and last name, and **Integers** for ID)
- Create a schema in the database to accommodate storing the CSV data.
- Transact the file upload as one transaction to the database.
- The service should support multiple file uploads simultaneously and multiple uploads of the same file.
